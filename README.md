Abstract
Since the dawn of agriculture, irrigation has been the backbone of human civilisation. In the daily greenhouse routine, it is the most important cultural activity and the most labor-intensive task. This will make it simple to provide plants water when they are thirsty. Knowing when to irrigate and how much to irrigate are two crucial aspects of the watering process. The automated plant watering system is created to help the planter run smoothly. We also take care of the plants on our rooftop gardens at home. Most individuals are too sluggish to water these plants every day throughout the heat. Alternatively, we may be anxious about our plants when we go out of town for a few days since they require frequent watering. So, we're going to use Arduino to create an automatic plant irrigation system. A Soil Moisture Sensor examines the moisture level in the soil in this Plant Irrigation System, and if it's too low, Arduino triggers a water pump to deliver water to the plant. When the gadget detects enough moisture in the soil, the water pump turns off automatically.
